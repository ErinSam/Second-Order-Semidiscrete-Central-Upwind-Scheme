# Second-Order-Semidiscrete-Central-Upwind-Scheme
The second-order semidiscrete central-upwind scheme is used to model compressible flow systems. 
The equations governing the flow are the equation of mass conservation, energy conservation 
and the compressible Euler Equations. 
<br /> <br />
An OpenMP parallelized numerical framework written in C++, controlled through simple Python scripts 
by the use of pybind11, is in use to implement the semidiscrete central-upwind scheme. The implementation 
is tested through a number of classic examples with known solutions.
